This web app has been developed using the popular Django framework and Bootstrap for the frontend. My motivation to build this project is so that I can learn about Django and tighten up my skills. This mini-app can be easily integrated into a bigger system project that needs to have a registration and login system.

**Quick Start**

To get this project up and running locally on your computer follow the following steps.

Set up a python virtual environment

Run the following commands:

  1.pip install -r requirements.txt<br>
  2.python manage.py makemigrations<br>
  3.python manage.py migrate<br>
  4.python manage.py createsuperuser<br>
  5.python manage.py runserver<br>
  
Open a browser and go to http://localhost:8000/
