This web app has been developed using the popular Django framework and Bootstrap for the frontend. My motivation to build this project is so that I can learn about Django and tighten up my skills. This mini-app can be easily integrated into a bigger system project that needs to have a registration and login system.

**Quick Start

To get this project up and running locally on your computer follow the following steps.

Set up a python virtual environment

Run the following commands

pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver
Open a browser and go to http://localhost:8000/register
